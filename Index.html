        <p>
            Hello there! I'm Fabiha Atique, a passionate computer science student who finds joy in translating ideas into
            lines of code. My journey in the vast realm of technology has been an exciting adventure, and I'm here to
            share it with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            My heart lies in web and application development, where creativity meets functionality. I thrive on crafting
            seamless user experiences and building robust systems that make a difference. Beyond coding, I am deeply
            fascinated by the possibilities of cloud computing, and I am always eager to explore new horizons in this
            ever-evolving field.
        </p>
        <p>
            Join me on this coding journey, where innovation knows no bounds and every line of code is a step towards
            shaping the future.
        </p>
